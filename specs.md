### user stories

As a user, you can :

1. View posted projects and their details
2. Post a project to be rated/reviewed
3. Rate/ review other users' projects
4. Search for projects
5. View projects overall score
6. View your profile page

#### Rating

A project can be rated based on 3 different criteria:
- Design 
- Usability 
- Content

> These criteria can be reviewed on a scale of 1-10 and the average score is taken.

#### API endpoints through which users can access data from my application.I have created these two:

1. Profile - This endpoint should return all the user profiles with information such as the username, bio, projects of the user and profile picture
2. Projects- This endpoint should return information pertaining to all the projects posted in your application.
